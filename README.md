# TransMetaSegmentation (TMS) extends mass spectrometry imaging to single-cell resolution

This document describes the 4 steps required to co-register images from mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) and single-cell spatial transcriptomics (SST), segment the MSI image using the cell boundary and cell type information from the SST image, and quantify the metabolite signal in individual cells.

### Step 1: 
Export the csv file from the SCiLS Lab software
